He holds an MSc degree in Computer Science from the Technical University of Lodz.

Paweł Jacewicz (Chapter Lead)

Paweł Jacewicz works as a security specialist in R&D Team at CERT Polska. His professional area of interest are client-side attacks, honeypots, web threats and new methods of malware propagation. He participated in security projects such as WOMBAT, HoneySpider Network and data sharing project - n6. Paweł is a co-author of trainings and workshops about client-side threats. Currently he is involved in the design of HoneySpider Network 2.0.

Łukasz Juszczyk

Łukasz Juszczyk works as an IT security specialist. His interests in the field of computer and network security include intrusion detection, computer forensics, honeypots and malware analysis. He holds a MSc in Information Technology from the Polish-Japanese Institute of Information Technology. Co-author of two reports for European Network and Information Security Agency on proactive detection of network security incidents. Speaker at security conferences, including TERENA TF-CSIRT, OWASP chapter meeting. Co-authored and conducted workshops during the SECURE conferences. Łukasz is a rock climber, he enjoys reading science-fiction books and watching good movies.

Piotr Kijewski (Founder)

Piotr Kijewski works for NASK as part of the CERT Polska team since 2002. He became head of the team in April 2010. His main interests in the computer and network security field include intrusion detection, honeypots and network forensics. Apart from heading the CERT operational activity, he also heads a group of people from various teams at NASK that is responsible for the development of novel solutions in the area of network and threat monitoring. This includes work on projects such as ARAKIS, a network early warning system that consists of over 50 sensors (that include a honeypot capability) across Polish networks and the HoneySpider Network , a joint effort with GOVCERT.NL and SURFnet to develop a complete client honeypot system. Speaker at various international conferences and workshops (FIRST Annual Conference, Honeynet Project Annual Workshop, NATO Cyber Defense, ENISA events, GOVCERT.NL symposium, TF-CSIRT meetings etc). Piotr Kijewski is the leader of the NASK team that was involved in the EU FP7 WOMBAT (Worldwide Observatory of Malicious Behaviour and Attack Threats) project. He has also taken part in other European projects such as eCSIRT.net, SPOTSPAM and ENISA studies (including co-authoring the ENISA CSIRT Exercise Book, as well as membership in the EISAS WG and PROCENT WG). Previously he has worked for nearly 10 years as a network administrator at the Warsaw University of Technology and as a network security consultant for many companies in Poland. He holds an MSc degree in Telecommunications from the Warsaw University of Technology.

Adam Kozakiewicz

Adam Kozakiewicz is Assistant Professor and head of the Network and Information Security Methods Team in the Research Division of NASK, and also part time Assistant Professor at the Institute of Control and Computation Engineering of the Warsaw University of Technology. MSc in information technology and PhD in telecommunications from Warsaw University of Technology, Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology. Author or coauthor of over twenty publications. Participated in several security-related projects at NASK, including WOMBAT, FISHA, ARAKIS and HoneySpider Network. NASK represesentative in Technical Committee 182 (Information Technology - Security Techniques) of the Polish Committee for Standardization. His research interests encompass network and information systems security (especially heuristic methods for threat detection), mathematical modeling of network traffic and parallel and distributed computation.

Currently he leads NASK efforts in the project "Secure workstation for special applications", aiming to create a workstation using virtualization to separate sensitive information from different security domains. The project scope also includes access control issues (access control models, biometric and non-biometric identification) and audit support.

He is also involved in the project "System for protection against network threats", developing a system for detection and automatic reaction to network threats for a large network joining several domains under control of mutually independent units.

His research also recently includes using lexical analysis of domain names for detection of malicious WWW sites.

Krzysztof Lasota

Krzysztof Lasota works as Research Associate at Network and Information Security Methods Team in the Research Division of NASK. BSc in telecommunications and MSc in telecommunications from Warsaw University of Technology, Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology. Coauthor of several publications. Participated in security-related projects at NASK, including FISHA and HoneySpider Network. Currently he participates in the project "Secure workstation for special applications", aiming to create a workstation using virtualization to separate sensitive information from different security domains. The project scope also includes access control issues (access control models, biometric and non-biometric identification) and audit support. Furthermore, his research aimes at developing new heuristic methods for threat detection. The study focuses on the possibilities of using lexical properties of domain names for detection of malicious WWW sites.

Paweł Pawliński

Paweł Pawliński is a specialist in the Security Projects Team at CERT Polska. His main interests in the domain of network security include intrusion detection systems, anomaly detection algorithms, client honeypots and visualization. Currently he is involved in the design of the HoneySpider Network 2.0 project and a platform for sharing security-related data. He holds a MSc degree in Computer Science from the Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology in Warsaw University of Technology.
